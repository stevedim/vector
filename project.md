# Project Overview

This game is a 2D platformer inspired by Vector (by Nekki), designed to deliver a fast-paced, visually striking, and impactful experience in a dreamlike world.

## Introduction

Players begin by selecting their character and environment. The game opens with the characters side by side, names floating above their heads, setting a cooperative yet competitive tone.

Suddenly, an enemy appears, and the chase begins:
- Players must run, jump, and dodge obstacles to stay ahead
- If a player is caught, it's Game Over for them, while the other player continues

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Puzzle-Powered Abilities

  - **Electrify Enemy** – temporarily stun the enemy

### Environment Selection
